The **Times Table Animation** holds a surprising secret beyond its educational benefitsâ€”it can produce captivating mathematical curves like the cardiod, nephroid, and more. By cleverly combining multiplication tables with geometric shapes, this animation uncovers the hidden beauty of mathematics. As each multiplication fact is represented by a specific movement or pattern, these intricate shapes emerge on the screen, mesmerizing viewers with their elegance. The cardioid, with its heart-like form, comes to life through the animation's rhythmic multiplication patterns. Similarly, the nephroid, resembling a kidney bean, appears as the animation unravels the multiplication secrets. This intriguing fusion of math and art not only enriches students' understanding of multiplication but also introduces them to the fascinating world of mathematical curves, sparking curiosity and appreciation for the wonders of mathematics.

#### How can we reproduce this 

```js
let factor = 2
let totalPoints = 400
let radius

const setup = () => {
  createCanvas(500, 500);
  radius = width/2 - 20
};

function getVector(index){
  let angle = map(index % totalPoints, 0, totalPoints, 0, TWO_PI)
  
  let v = {
    x: cos(angle + PI)*radius,
    y: sin(angle + PI)*radius
  }

  return v
}

const draw = () => {
  background(255);

  translate(width/2, height/2)
  circle(0, 0, radius*2)

  if(factor < 10)
  factor += 0.03

  for(let i = 0; i < totalPoints; i++){
    circle(getVector(i).x , getVector(i).y, 5)
    line(getVector(i).x , getVector(i).y , getVector(i * factor).x , getVector(i*factor).y)
  }
}
```
