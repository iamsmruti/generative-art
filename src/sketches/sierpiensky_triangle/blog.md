**The Sierpiensky Triangle**, a captivating mathematical construct, has enthralled mathematicians, artists, and enthusiasts for over a century. Named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, this mesmerizing fractal showcases the mesmerizing beauty of self-similarity and infinite complexity.

At its core, the Sierpiensky Triangle is an equilateral triangle divided into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles. The process continues as each of these smaller triangles is further divided into four even tinier triangles, ad infinitum. The central triangle from each iteration is removed, leaving behind a pattern of triangles nested within triangles.

#### Algorithm to reproduce this pattern
- Take a Square at the center
- Then, add more square half the length of the previously taken square and place on any three sides of the squares.
- Repeat this step over and over to get this pattern 

We can use p5.js to code the pattern. p5 is a javascript library for drawing and animation. Here is the following code.

```js
let x = 50;
let y = 50;

const setup = (canvasParentRef) => {
  createCanvas(500, 500).parent(canvasParentRef);
  background(255);
};

const drawRect = (x,y,d) => {
  noFill();
  rectMode(CENTER)
  rect(x, y, d, d);
  strokeWeight(0.5);
  
  if(d < 1) return;

  setTimeout(() => {
    drawRect(x, y - d/2, d/2);
  }, 50)

  setTimeout(() => {
    drawRect(x + d/2, y, d/2);
  }, 70)

  setTimeout(() => {
    drawRect(x - d/2, y, d/2);
  }, 90)
}

const draw = (p5) => {
  drawRect(width/2, height/2, 200)
}
```

#### Some of the facts about Sierpiensky Triangle
