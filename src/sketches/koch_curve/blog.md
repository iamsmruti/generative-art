Fractals have long been a subject of fascination in the world of mathematics, captivating mathematicians, scientists, and artists with their mesmerizing properties. One such captivating fractal is the Koch curve, also known as the Koch snowflake curve, which holds immense mathematical significance. Named after the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch, this intriguing curve not only showcases the beauty of self-similarity but also offers profound insights into the realm of infinite complexity.

**Iterative Construction and Self-Similarity**:
At the heart of the Koch curve lies its iterative construction, a process that unfolds the infinite intricacy of the curve. 
- Starting with a single line segment, each segment undergoes a transformation, where it is divided into four smaller segments.
- The middle segment is then replaced by two smaller segments forming a new shape.
- This iterative process continues indefinitely, leading to an infinitely complex curve.
- At each iteration, the Koch curve exhibits self-similarityâ€”smaller parts of the curve resemble the whole, albeit at different scales.
- This remarkable property emphasizes the fractal nature of the Koch curve, where complexity remains constant, regardless of the level of magnification.

*We can create a snowflake like pattern using this koch curve. This snowflake pattern is called the [Koch SnowFlake](/sketch/koch_snowflake). You can read about that in this [article](/sketch/koch_snowflake)*

#### Here is how we can reproduce it

```js
let start, end

const setup = () => {  
  createCanvas(500, 500)
  let length = 400;

  start = {
    x: width / 2 - length / 2,
    y: height / 2
  }

  end = {
    x: width / 2 + length / 2,
    y: height / 2
  }
};

const draw = (p5) => {
  background(255)
  kochSnowflake(start, end, currDepth);
}

```
*kochSnowflake()* is defined below. This is the main function that divides a line segment into four new line segment according to the koch's algorithm.

```js
function kochSnowflake(start, end, depth) {
  if (depth === 0) {
    drawLine(start, end);
  } else {
    let a = { x: start.x, y: start.y };
    let b = { x: start.x + (end.x - start.x) / 3, y: start.y + (end.y - start.y) / 3 };
    let c = { x: start.x + 2 * (end.x - start.x) / 3, y: start.y + 2 * (end.y - start.y) / 3 };
    let d = { x: end.x, y: end.y };

    let v = rotateVector(subtractVector(c, b), -PI / 3);
    let e = addVector(b, v);

    kochSnowflake(a, b, depth - 1);
    kochSnowflake(b, e, depth - 1);
    kochSnowflake(e, c, depth - 1);
    kochSnowflake(c, d, depth - 1);
  }
}

function drawLine(start, end) {
  line(start.x, start.y, end.x, end.y);
}

function subtractVector(v1, v2) {
  return { x: v1.x - v2.x, y: v1.y - v2.y };
}

function addVector(v1, v2) {
  return { x: v1.x + v2.x, y: v1.y + v2.y };
}

function rotateVector(v, angle) {
  let x = v.x * cos(angle) - v.y * sin(angle);
  let y = v.x * sin(angle) + v.y * cos(angle);
  return { x, y };
}
```

#### Fractal Dimension and Infinite Length:
One of the most intriguing aspects of the Koch curve is its fractal dimension. Unlike regular geometric shapes, which have integer dimensions (e.g., lines are 1D, squares are 2D), fractals can have non-integer dimensions. The Koch curve's fractal dimension is approximately 1.2618, lying between that of a 1D line and a 2D plane. This non-integer dimensionality reflects the curve's intricate structure, allowing it to fill more space than a typical one-dimensional line, yet not enough to qualify as a two-dimensional shape.

Moreover, the Koch curve exhibits an astonishing paradox. While each iteration adds a finite amount of length to the curve, the total length of the curve approaches infinity as the number of iterations increases. This property defies our intuitive understanding of curves and raises fascinating questions about the concept of infinity in mathematics.

#### Some Key Points

1. **Fractals and Self-Similarity:** The Koch Curve is a prime example of a fractal, showcasing the property of self-similarity. At every iteration, smaller parts of the curve resemble the entire curve, albeit at different scales. This characteristic is fundamental to understanding fractals.
